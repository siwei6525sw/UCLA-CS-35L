Linux and Emacs Scavenger Hunt
------------------------------

(1)

man man

Seeing that -k was defined as the same as apropos, I opened its manual. 

man apropos

I then tested the command. 

man -k the

By typing 'man -k <keyword>' we print all the commands that have
the word <keyword> in the description of their man page.

(2)

I used the which command to find the location of each executable.

which cp
which wc

The cp program is located in /bin/cp.
The wc program is located in /bin/wc.

(3)

I used the find manual to determine how to search for a one letter executable
and used whatis to determine its function.

man find
find / -executable -name '?'

After finding too many in the root, I searched each of the directories
in the $PATH.

echo $PATH
find /usr/local/cs/bin/ /usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin /u/cs/ugrad/aziz/perl5/bin
/usr/lib64/ccache /usr/local/bin /usr/bin /usr/X11R6/bin
/u/cs/ugrad/aziz/bin -executable -name '?'

I then determined each executable's function.

whatis X
X
whatis w
whatis [
man [

I found that there are the following one character long executables:

X: starts an X server
w: shows who is logged on and what they are doing
[: builtin bash command that tests a condition and returns a boolean status

(4)

I navigated to the bin and used the long list to find where emacs is linked to.

cd /usr/bin
ls -l emacs

The file actually exectuted is located in /etc/alternatives/emacs.

(5)

I used the chmod manual to determine what each tag meant. I then tested each
 using a txt file.

man chmod
touch test.txt
ls -l
chmod g+s test.txt
ls -l
chmod o+x test.txt
ls -l
chmod o-x test.txt
ls -l

I found that g+s sets the group permission for anyone to execute with
the group's ID and permissions, and o-x removes others'
(people who are not user or in group) ability to execute the file.

(6)

man find
find <directory> -ctime -21 -type f

Using the command 'find . -ctime -21 -type f' we can list all files that
have been modified in the last 3 weeks (21 days).

(7)

Running 'find / -ctime -21 -type d' on the linux server, I generated far
too many directories to list here that were edited in the last 3 weeks.
However, I listed some:

/usr/local/cs/src/emacs
/usr/local/cs/src/emacs/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/gcc
/usr/local/cs/src/gcc/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/gdb
/usr/local/cs/src/gdb/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/gettext/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/gprolog/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/grep
/usr/local/cs/src/grep/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/gzip/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/help2man/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/jdk
/usr/local/cs/src/jdk/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/m4
/usr/local/cs/src/m4/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/make/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/mpc/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/ocaml
/usr/local/cs/src/ocaml/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/python/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/racket/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/tar/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/twisted/RCS
/usr/local/cs/include/c++
/usr/local/cs/lib64
/usr/local/cs/share
/usr/local/cs/share/info
/usr/local/cs/share/man/man1
/usr/local/cs/share/man/man7
/usr/local/cs/share/man/man5
/usr/local/cs/share/man/man3
/usr/local/cs/bin
/usr/local/cs/.del

(8)

I first navigated to the directory that contained find.

which find
cd /usr/bin/

Then I determined how to symbolic links, and count them using wc.

man find
man wc
find . -type l | wc -l

On lnxsrv09, I found 293 symbolic links.

(9)

I dermined how to order files by time.

man ls
ls -lt

The oldest file on the linux server was detect_ppa from 2000-09-08.

(10)

man locale

The locale man page informed me that the command gets its data from
predefined environment variables.

(11)

After running emacs, I was informed how to reach the help screen,
from which I was informed how to show commands whose name matches
a pattern.

emacs
C-h
C-h a sort

I then recalled how to switch buffers from previous classes.

C-x o

I scrolled to find the commands with sort are:

Buffer-menu-sort
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields
tabulated-list-col-sort
tabulated-list-sort

(12)

First I showed the commands available by following the on-screen
guidlines.

C-h
?
b

Then I switched to the buffer and searched for commands of C-M-a
through C-M-h.

C-x o
C-s 'C-M'

This revealed the following:

C-M-a           beginning-of-defun
C-M-b           backward-sexp
C-M-c           exit-recursive-edit
C-M-d           down-list
C-M-e           end-of-defun
C-M-f           forward-sexp
C-M-h           mark-defun

By pressing enter on each one I could see more detailed descriptions:

C-M-a	Move back to the beginning of a defun
C-M-b	Move backwards across one balanced expression
C-M-c	Exit the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer
C-M-d	Move forward down one level of parentheses
C-M-e	Move forward to the next end of defun
C-M-f	Move forward across one balanced expression
C-M-h	Put a mark at the end of this defun and point at beginning.

(13)

Using the same method as in question 12, I found that keyboard-quit
is bound to C-g.
This is described as:

Signal a ‘quit’ condition.
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

This, simply, means that the keystroke quits whatever you are doing.

(14)

After going back, I searched for yank and through a simlar method to
find its description

C-s yank

I found the following description:

Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the
stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.  Put point
at the end, and set mark at the beginning without activating it.
With just C-u as argument, put point at beginning, and mark at end.
With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recent kill.

This means that C-s pastes whatever is on the clipboard.
Simply put, text is copied to the clipboard when it is killed,
such as through C-k, which kills a line of text.

(15)

Referring to the same help menu through C-h ? b, I was able to search
for dired.

C-s dired

I found that the dired command can delte, rename, and print files,
in addition to use all of the 'ls' options.
The dired command even allows flagging files for deletion and
manipulating the directory listings in a window.
These are features unavailable with the 'ls' command.
