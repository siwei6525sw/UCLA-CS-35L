Homework: Rewriting a script
----------------------------

Q1.

Looking at the patch, I can see that Brady removed the line
'case_long_iso_time_style:' because it was duplicated. While this
makes sense to delete it, it was not necessary for the patch
because it did not affect the ultimate functionality.

Q2.  

The patch version of Coreutils could introduce many problems.
For example, if a script relies on the older format of the date
output of ls, then that script would have to be rewritten with the
new format. Non English speakers would be more confused, as the
months are now spelled out. In addition, the day comes after the
month but before the year, which may be confusing to people from
other cutlures. Lastly, the dates are harder to compare for
humans and computers because of the dates ordering and non-numeric
format.

Q3.

python randline.py /dev/null

  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
    # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

The randline.py script indexes the elements in a file. From the
trace, we can see that a comment indicates that if the array
'seq' is empty we will get IndexError. This is exactly what
occurs because we tried to read an empty file.

Q3.

python3 randline.py /dev/null

  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Since we ran the script with Python 3 instead of Python 2, we
get a SyntaxError instead of an IndexError. This is because
instead of using a tuple, Python 3 changed the automatic tuple
unpacking of IOError and merged the parameters in OSError.
This could be fixed using the following:

except OSError as err:
       parser.error("OS error: {0}".format(err))
