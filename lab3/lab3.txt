Assignment 3. Modifying and rewriting software

Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package
------------------------------------------------------

1. I started by grabbing and uncompressing it Coreutils 7.6

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

2. I then enter the coreutils directory and read the Installation Instructions

cd coreutils-7.6/
ls
emacs INSTALL

I now know to add the prefix option to ./configure to  change the install
location from 'usr/local/bin' to my current directory.

./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/aziz/35L/lab3

Now we compile and move the files to the lab3 directory.

make
make install

We then move to '/u/cs/ugrad/aziz/35L/lab3' and run the 'ls' command that is
in this directory and compare it with the version in '/usr/local/cs/bin/ls'.

ls -l /bin/bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 Aug  3 06:36 /bin/bash

./ls -l /bin/bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 2017-08-03 06:36 /bin/bash

As described in the assignment, we are getting YYYY-MM-DD instead of the
traditional Unix date. In order to fix this bug, we will apply the patch.

We apply the patch by copying the patch into the 'coreutils-7.6' directory.
Then we need to get rid of the 'a/' and 'b/' directories from the beginning
of the patch file with the '-p1' option before patching.

cd coreutils-7.6
emacs patch_file
[paste patch]
patch -p1 < patch_file

[aziz@lnxsrv09 ~/35L/lab3/coreutils-7.6]$ make

These commands compile and link ls and its dependencies.
CC compiles the file and LD links the dependency

  CC     ls.o
  CCLD   dir
  CCLD   vdir
  CCLD   ls

The GEN commands create documentation for the given file.
These commands are not essentail whereas the commands above are.

  GEN    dir.1
  GEN    vdir.1
  GEN    ls.1

The commands not listed simply recursively searched each
of the directories, usually finding nothing to be done for
each.

I now test the modifications to ls by using it on two text files.

touch testfile.txt
touch -t 201001010101.00 oldtestfile.txt
ls -l
./ls -l

-rw-r--r--  1 aziz csugrad       0 Jan  1  2010 oldtestfile.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 aziz csugrad       0 Oct 22 13:44 testfile.txt

Horrah. The change to ls correctly fixed the bug.
