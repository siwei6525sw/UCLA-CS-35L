SSH setup and use in applications
Homework Questions
------------------

1.

The resulting network is secured by having all of the data sent
to the server is encrypted with the client's private key and the
server's public key so that it can be decrypted on the server
with the client's public key and the server's private key.

(1) If another team had been observing all the bytes across the
network, the network would still be secure because I used a
password to originally authenticate myself as the client and send
my public key that is associated with my private key. Since another
team would not know my private key, and my private key is never sent
across the network, they would not be able to correctly SSH to the
server using my private key.

(2) If the other team had temporary physical control of the USB, they
would gain access to my private and public keys which could be used
to SSH to the server. However, if I were to create a password for my
private key, this vulnerability would be avoided.

2.

The 'gpg --verify' command attempts to verify that the sent data was not
altered. The data is previously hashed and the hash is encrypted using
the signer's private key. Then, during the verification, the hash is
decrypted using the signer’s public key and the data is rehashed and
this new hash is compared to the sent hash to guarantee that the sent
data was not altered. However, this verification process is vulnerable
to a man in the middle that sends their own public key and data that is
hashed using the man in the middle’s private key. Then the modified data
will pass the verification. To avoid this problem, we can use a
certification authority to make sure we are using the correct public key
of the sender when we decrypt the hash that was sent. This guarantees
that the data was signed by the intended sender.
