SSH setup and use in applications laboratory
--------------------------------------------

My partner for this lab is Sheldon Dong.

To setup, I followed the instructions on Piazza. This included downloading
drivers onto my local computer, enabling wifi on the BeagleBone. I SSH into
my BeagleBone and updated apt-get and used it to install xauth and firefox.
Again, these instructions are all explained in detail on the class Piazza.

We start by setting up my BeagleBone so that my partner can SSH to me.
To generate a public and private key I use the following command with the
default settings.

ssh-keygen

I then create a user and password for Sheldon.

sudo useradd -d /home/sheldon -m sheldon
sudo passwd sheldon

Next I create the .ssh folder in Sheldon's home directory and give him
ownership.

cd /home/sheldon
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R sheldon .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Sheldon can now SSH onto my BeagleBone for his client part of the lab.
After Sheldon has set up a user that I can use, I SSH onto his BeagleBone
using the following techniques.

To determine our ip addresses, we looked under the 'inet addr' part of the
'wlan0' section after running 'ifconfig'.

I first copy my public key to my partner and enter my password:

ssh-copy-id â€“i chris@149.142.34.173

Then I explicitly add my private key to the authetication agent.

ssh-add

I can now SSH to my partner's server.

ssh -X chris@149.142.34.173
firefox

I was able to successfully open firefox and other programs on the remote
host.
