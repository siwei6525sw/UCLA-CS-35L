Description of gitk
-------------------

On the top, there is a window with three columns. The first column contains
a history of all the commits in a branching tree structure. The commits are
labeled with the beginning of their change log. The second column contains
the author and email of the selected commit, and the third column contains the
date. The middle contains the SHA1 ID of the commit and a search field.
The bottom left window contains the diff of the commit for the modified files.
Instead of a diff, the old or new versions can also be selected.
The bottom right window contains a way to view the names of and select the
modifed files, in either a patch or tree format.
