Homework: Verifying and publishing a backported change
------------------------------------------------------

1.

(This file)

2.

I was able to check out version 3.0 of Diffutils from my repository into a new
branch named 'quote' using:

git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3.

Using my patch, I patched this new branch:

patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt 

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4.

I learned how to use the Emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window
(C-x 4 a).

5.

I went through each modified file and used (C-x 4 a) to update the ChangeLog
with the appropriate message for each of the six files. For example:

* cmp.c: Replace grave accents from character string constants with single
quotes


6.

I then committed the patch to the new branch with the ChangeLog entry as the
commit message using:

git commit -Fa src/ChangeLog

7.

I used the following to create a formatted patch:

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8.

My partner for this lab is Ken Gu.  He sent me his patch which I renamed
'formatted-patch-ken.txt'.

I first switched to a new branch called 'partner':

git checkout v3.0 -b partner

Then I applied my partner's patch:

git am ../formatted-patch-ken.txt

Applying: 2017-12-02 Qi Kun Gu <qig@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>

I then repeated the compilation process as described before:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

I confirmed that the patch worked.

9.

I used 'make distdir' and then opened the ChangeLog file and observed my
partner's change as the most recent entry in the log. I can also verify that
grave accents were replaced by quotes in outputs.

10.

Lastly, I create a new directory for the GNU Emacs git repository's master
branch. Since I found that '~eggert/src/gnu/emacs' did not exist, I instead
cloned it from 'gnu.org'.

mkdir emacs-master
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git emacs-master

I then downloaded XQuartz, relogged in and ssh to the lnxsrv09 with the '-Y'
option. I then used:

cd emacs-master
gitk

This launched XQuartz with the gitk UI.
I found that the newest merge that is not newer than 2015-01-25 is by Paul
Eggert and changes the test/indent/shell.sh file to use '-eq' instead of
'=='. The SHA1 ID for this commit is:

407e6beeb3c37947c7c92bf0d230973bf133afde
