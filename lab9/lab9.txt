Laboratory: Managing a backported change
----------------------------------------

1.

I begin by copying the diffutils directory:

cp -r ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils .

2.

I then copy the output of 'git log' to the file 'git-log.txt':

git log > git-log.txt

3.

I do the same with 'git tag':

git tag > git-tags.txt

4.

I opened 'git-log.txt' in emacs and used C-s to search for the commit entitled
“maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'”. I then copy the
commit ID and create a patch file with 'git show' followed by this ID:

git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

5.

From the 'git-tags.txt' file, we can see that the version 3.0 of Difftils
is called 'v3.0'. We check it out using:

git checkout v3.0

6.

We can now apply the patch. We use the '-p1' option because we are in the
diffutils directory:

patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

During the patch, we run into problems when some of the hunks fail to patch.
We skip these by pressing RETURN. The rejects are saved to '.rej' files.
The output of the patch is as follows:

|    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
|    
|    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
|    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
|    `like this' or ``like this''.

We now use the 'git status' command to see what has changed:

HEAD detached at v3.0

  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)

I read and learned how to use the 'vc-diff' and 'vc-revert' commands in emacs.
In addition, I used 'describe-mode' to learn how to use the 'diff-apply-hunk'
and 'diff-goto-source' functions.

9.

I can now  go through each of the modified files that are not .c files and use
'C-x v =' to generate the diff buffer and 'C-x v u' to revert the file to be
what it was before the patch.
For the .c files, I went through each one and used 'C-c C-a' to revert changes
that didn't affect string constants.

10.

Next, I opened the src/*.c.rej files in emacs and applied their changes in
the corresponding src/*.c files by searching with 'C-s' and then manually
applying the change.

11.

I remove all untracked files listed that 'git status' warns me about. I use
'rm -r *.{rej,orig}' to make this process quicker.

12.

I see that 'git status' correctly reports 6 modified files and I use the
following command to create a patch file:

git diff > quote-patch.txt


13.

I use the 'README-hacking' file to build the resulting modified version of
Diffutils on the older lnxsrv:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

We can verify that the patch was successful by using the commands
'diff . -' and 'diff --help'. We see that the output uses quotes 'like this'
or "like this", not `like this'. The patch worked! Hoorah.

14.

I start by copying my source code .c files of the patch to a directory called
'diffutils-3.0-patch':

mkdir ../diffutils-3.0-patch
cp -r src/*.c ../diffutils-3.0-patch/

I then get a clean version of version 3.0 of Diffutils and copy its source code
.c files to 'diffutils-3.0':

mkdir ../diffutils-3.0
cp -r ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils ../diffutils-unpatched
cd ../diffutils-unpatched
git checkout v3.0
cp -r src/*.c ../diffutils-3.0/

We can now compare the source code of our patched version to the orignal version
3.0 of Diffutils through the following:

cd ..
./diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch > quote-3.0-test.txt
diff -u quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt


15.

I can see that the output of my new patch changes only the source files that
had character-strings that were quoted incorrectly. This is what we want. The
difference are innoucuous as they do not change the overall functionality of
the program.
